# I believe there are a few ways to do this:
#
#    1. My current way, using a minimal /etc/nixos/configuration.nix that just imports my config from my home directory (see it in the gist)
#    2. Symlinking to your own configuration.nix in your home directory (I think I tried and abandoned this and links made relative paths weird)
#    3. My new favourite way: as @clot27 says, you can provide nixos-rebuild with a path to the config, allowing it to be entirely inside your dotfies, with zero bootstrapping of files required.
#       `nixos-rebuild switch -I nixos-config=path/to/configuration.nix`
#    4. If you uses a flake as your primary config, you can specify a path to `configuration.nix` in it and then `nixos-rebuild switch â€”flake` path/to/directory
# As I hope was clear from the video, I am new to nixos, and there may be other, better, options, in which case I'd love to know them! (I'll update the gist if so)
